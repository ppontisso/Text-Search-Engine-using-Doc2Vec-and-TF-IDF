# How to make a search engine on Movies Description

In this notebook, you will learn how to :

1. Create a Doc2Vec model that represents words and documents into numerical vectors
2. Find words related to other words
3. Find the document that has the closest meaning to a list of key words like in a search engine
4. Create a TF-IDF search engine

We will use the package gensim to help us implement the functions that we need.

This notebook has been made for a school project at ISAE-SUPAERO.
